<h2>Position for Masters student</h2> 

<i>Update: This position has now been filled.</i>

<br><br>

<b><u>January 2021</u></b>: I have a funded position available for a student to do a full-time Masters by Dissertation in Computer Science at the University of Cape Town, starting in March 2021 or soon afterwards. 
This is a 2-year research degree with no coursework requirement. 
Applicants should have a 4-year Bachelor's or Honours degree majoring in Computer Science.
Prior experience in Machine Learning or Natural Language Processing is required - this could be through coursework, self-study, work experience or doing a research project in the area. 

The research project will be in the area of deep learning-based text generation for low-resource languages. 
The position will be funded through a scholarship. 

<h3>How to apply</h3>

Please <a href="mailto:jbuys@cs.uct.ac.za">email</a> me the following:

<br>
<br>

<ul class="emlist">
<li> a CV </li>
<li> academic transcript </li>
<li> a sample of academic writing </li>
<li> a 1-page statement of your research interests </li>
</ul>

Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. 
Suitable candidates may be contacted for an interview.
The university will only admit candidates who already have an agreed supervisor, so do not apply to UCT earlier.
